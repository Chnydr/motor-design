where F = N*I = 120 A\*100 t = 12000 A, airgap reluctance R = 0.01/(A\*u_0) and Phi=B\*A. Therefore airgap flux density can be obtained as: B = N\*I\*u_0 / 0.01 = **1.508 T**.

**2.** L = N^2/R, R = 0.01/(A\*u_0) as stated before. A=0.02 m^2, L=10000\*u_0\*2= **25 mH**.

**3.** Magnetic flux density distribution assuming that relative permeability of the core is 1000:
