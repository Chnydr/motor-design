### Assignment #1

1. Assuming the core is infinitely permeable, the equivalent magnetic circuit of the system becomes

where F = N*I = 120 A\*100 t = 12000 A, airgap reluctance R = 0.01/(A\*u_0) and Phi=B\*A. Therefore airgap flux density can be obtained as: B = N\*I\*u_0 / 0.01 = 1.508 T.

2. L = N^2/R, R = 0.01/(A\*u_0) as stated before. A=0.02 m^2, L=10000\*u_0\*2= 25 mH.
