**Objective**  
In this report, flux distribution in a C-core will be investigated in detail. The C-core will firstly examined with analytically. Then, the core will be modelled on a FEA software. The differences between Analytical and Software results will be compared at the end.  

**Properties of the C-core**

1. Flux Density in the airgap  

F = Reluctance * Flux = Field Strenth (H) * lgap 

We also know that 

F = NI = Hl => F*mü= B*l
