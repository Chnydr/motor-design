- The number of turns and current is not given. Choose these parameters such that to get around 0.5 T in the airgap. You can assume the current stays constant:

For N=50 and I=160A, flux density distribution in the airgap is given below:

- Assume the C-core and plunger have relative permeability of 1000 and linear (Bonus: you can also get the non-linear properties as you used in Week 1 simulations).

- The plunger is vertically positioned at the center of the airgap (i.e. 0.5mm gap each side), and only move in horizontal direction.
